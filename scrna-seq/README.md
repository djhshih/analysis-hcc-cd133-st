# scRNA-seq analysis

## Samples

- Prom1-WT: control sample from liver, non-immune cells
- Prom1-DTA: treatment sample from Prom1-depleted liver, non-immune cells
- Prom1-WT-IMM: control sample from liver, immune cells
- Prom1-DTA-IMM: treatment sample from Prom1-depleted liver, immune cells

## Pre-processing

Generate expression matrix
```
cellranger count
```

Since the knee plot generated by cellranger for the non-immune looks atypical,
we used alternative cell calling strategy based on expression profiles vs.
background profiles.
```
call-cells.R
```

Quality control
```
qc.R
```

Aggregate treatment and control samples together for immune cells
and for non-immune cells separately
```
cellranger aggr
```

Quality control on the aggregated samples
```
qc_aggr.R
```

## Analysis

```
analyze-immune.R
analyze-immune_refine.R
